                  <strong>DISCLAIMER FOR CASTING/ RECRUITMENT</strong>
                </h5>
                <p>
                  We at Dharma Productions Private Limited (&quot;Dharma&quot;) follow strict policies
                  and procedures with respect to recruitment and casting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dharma states that it does not associate with any agent, agency or any other
                  person(s) for the same without an appropriate legal agreement authorizing them to
                  act on it&apos;s behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dharma does not indulge in making monetary requests from any candidate(s) for the
                  purpose of recruitment and/or casting such candidate(s) whether through authorised
                  agents or otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If at any stage of recruitment and/or casting any monetary request is made to the
                  candidate, Dharma strictly advises the candidate to ignore such request or
                  initiate appropriate legal proceedings as may be advised in law in this regard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dharma shall not be held responsible for any such fraudulent email/phone
                  call/message asking the candidate for any monies, their bank account or credit card
                  details for an audition and/or employment opportunity with Dharma and the same
                  shall be dealt with by the candidate entirely at its own risk, cost and expense.
